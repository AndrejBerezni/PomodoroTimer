# PomodoroTimer

This app was created for learning purposes.

It is a timer that counts down selected time (between 1 and 60 minutes) and then starts a selected break, after which cycle repeats.

When timer reaches 0, sound is played.

Timer can be paused and resumed.

This project is part of requirements for **freeCodeCamp**'s *Front End Development Libraries Certification*.
